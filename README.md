# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques 🏠📊

This repository contains a complete solution for the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), which challenges participants to predict the final price of homes in Ames, Iowa based on various features.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Accurately predict housing prices using advanced regression models. The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## 🧪 Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Combined train and test datasets for uniform preprocessing
- Handled missing values using domain knowledge
- Converted categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Applied log-transformation on the target variable (`SalePrice`)

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created new features like total square footage, bathrooms per bedroom, etc.
- Applied skewness correction using Box-Cox transformation

### 3. Modeling Techniques
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **XGBoost**
- **LightGBM**
- **Stacked Regressor** (ensemble of the best models)

### 4. Evaluation
- Used cross-validation (K-Fold) with RMSE as the evaluation metric
- Stacked model performed best with the lowest RMSE on validation

## 📈 Result

- Generated final predictions for the test dataset (`submission.csv`)
- Final file meets Kaggle’s submission requirements (1459 rows, header)
- Achieved competitive performance on the leaderboard
